description: Build or check DreamFXLang sources headlessly — one .dfs file or the whole DFX tree — turning text into Niagara system assets without opening the Unreal editor. Use when asked to verify, validate, build, compile, test, or CI-gate .dfs / .dfe / .dfm / DreamFX sources, or to check whether a Niagara effect still generates from its source.

# dream-fx-verify `<file>` | `-All`

The DreamFX compile gate. Wraps `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe -run=DreamFX` so a check is one command and
one exit code. This is the harness the other DreamFX skills call.

Paths below are relative to the plugin root, `Plugins/DreamFX/`.

## Prefer the `dream` MCP server when it is connected

If the `dream` MCP server is available, call `dream_build` / `dream_verify` instead of the script
below, and `dream_schema` instead of `dfx.ps1 schema`.

It reaches a **running editor** through the bridge, which this script never does. Measured on this
project: a single-file verify is 537 ms through the bridge against roughly 12 s of engine boot here,
and a failing build reports the identical diagnostic either way. More importantly it removes the
double-write — with an editor open there is only ever one process writing packages, so the footgun
this page warns about below cannot happen. When no editor is running it runs this same script, and
when the editor is *hung* it refuses both, which is the one state where neither path is safe.

`dream_schema` reads the cached index off disk, so it answers in milliseconds and works with the
editor open — the gap that made people guess input names rather than look them up.

Fall back to the script when the server is not connected, and for everything the server deliberately
does not wrap: `decompile`, `rename`, `corpus`, `mirror-diff`, `asset-diff`, `index`, `coverage`,
`graph`. Those are low-frequency, long-running or destructive enough to want a human reading the
output.

## Run it

```bash
pwsh -File Plugins/DreamFX/.skill/dfx.ps1 build DFX/Samples/NS_DreamFXPhase1.dfs -Force
```

```bash
pwsh -File Plugins/DreamFX/.skill/dfx.ps1 build -All -Force
```

```bash
pwsh -File Plugins/DreamFX/.skill/dfx.ps1 verify -All
```

Exit `0` when the run produced no errors; otherwise the exit code **is the error count**. Run it
from anywhere inside the project.

Editor boot dominates the cost — roughly 12 s of the wall time regardless of how many files are
built. Batch edits rather than looping per file.

Close the editor before a build. Both processes write the same packages otherwise, and the one that
saves second wins silently; the run warns when it sees an editor but cannot tell which project that
editor has open. Large sources are slow for a structural reason, not a fixable one —
[Docs/performance-2026-08-08.md](../../../Plugins/DreamFX/Docs/performance-2026-08-08.md) has the measurements.

| Argument | Effect |
| :-- | :-- |
| *(positional)* | the source file — absolute, or relative to the working directory |
| `-All` | every source under every DFX root |
| `-Force` | bypass the provenance-hash skip. Without it an unchanged file reports `up to date` and proves nothing |
| `-NoSave` | build in memory without writing packages — the right flag for checking that source is valid |
| `-CleanNew` | delete the `.uasset` files this run wrote, **but only those git reports untracked**, then report the rest |
| `-NoWriteScope` | build the slow way, rebuilding the edit context per write. Diagnostic only — it exists so a benchmark can measure both halves on one binary |
| `-RebuildOnStructural` | the same, one epoch further in: drop the context after every structural write instead of trusting the engine's own in-place refresh. Also the escape hatch if an engine version stops refreshing the stack group it just changed |
| `-Project` | the `.uproject`. Defaults to the nearest one at or above the target, then the working directory |
| `-Engine` | engine root. Defaults to the `EngineAssociation` lookup; `UE_ENGINE_ROOT` also works |
| `-Raw` | print the whole engine log instead of just the `LogDreamFX` lines |

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- |
| `build` | generate assets from source |
| `verify` | check assets against source, writing nothing — the drift gate |
| `lint` | static checks only; no asset access, so it is the fastest failure |
| `decompile <asset>` | export an existing system back to source — see [`dream-fx-decompile`](../dream-fx-decompile/SKILL.md) |
| `coverage` | how much of a project's VFX DreamFX can represent |
| `graph` | what each source file depends on |
| `rename <asset>:<old>:<new>` | rename an emitter safely — see below |
| `schema <Module>` | print a module's real input signature; `-Stack` picks the stack |
| `list` | every module the search paths expose; `-DynamicInputs` for dynamic inputs |

## The CI gate

```bash
pwsh -File Plugins/DreamFX/.skill/ci.ps1
```

Runs lint, then build, then verify, and stops at the first failure with that step's exit code.
`-SkipBuild` checks without writing; `-CleanNew` removes assets the build newly created.

The verify step is the one worth having. It catches the case nobody notices: someone edited a `.dfs`,
did not rebuild, and committed both. Build alone passes, because build fixes it.

## Renaming an emitter

An emitter name is a **stable key, not a display name** — Niagara stores literal module inputs under
an emitter-prefixed alias. Renaming in source and rebuilding would drop the old emitter and add a new
one, taking its handle GUID with it, which breaks anything referencing the emitter by id.

Rename the asset first, then the source:

```bash
pwsh -File Plugins/DreamFX/.skill/dfx.ps1 rename /Game/FX/NS_Spark:Sparks:Embers
```

Then change the name in the `.dfs` and rebuild. The rebuild matches by the new name and reuses the
existing handle.

## What you get back

```text
dfx: build  project=DevTest.uproject  engine=F:\UnrealEngine\UE_Moon
=== DreamFX build: 1 source file(s) ===
=== DreamFX done: 1 built, 0 up to date, 0 failed | 0 error(s), 0 warning(s) ===

Assets written to disk by this run:
  Plugins/DreamFX/Content/Samples/NS_DreamFXPhase1.uasset  [NEW (untracked)]

dfx: OK (exit 0)
```

A failure names the file, line and column:

```text
…/BadInputName.bad.dfs(11,17): error DFX3003: Module 'GravityForce' has no input named 'Gravty'.
Did you mean 'Gravity'? Available inputs: Gravity, CoordinateSpace
dfx: FAILED (exit 1)
```

## The thing to understand about this command

**Niagara input names contain spaces; DreamFX identifiers cannot.** The real input is
`Loop Duration`, and you write `LoopDuration`. Matching is done on a normalised form — lowercase,
spaces and underscores removed — so `loop_duration` also resolves. Inline checkbox inputs live in
the `Module.` namespace (`Module.WriteLifetime`); the prefix is implied inside a module call, so
write `WriteLifetime`.

**`schema` is how you discover those names.** Do not guess them, and do not read them off the plan
document — modules get revised.

```bash
pwsh -File Plugins/DreamFX/.skill/dfx.ps1 schema InitializeParticle
```

Ambiguous short names are refused with the full candidate list rather than resolved arbitrarily:

```text
'InitializeParticle' is ambiguous -- 2 modules match. Write the full path instead:
/Niagara/Modules/Spawn/Initialization/InitializeParticle.InitializeParticle,
/Niagara/Modules/Spawn/Initialization/V2/InitializeParticle.InitializeParticle
```

A partial path disambiguates and is anchored at the end, so
`Spawn/Initialization/InitializeParticle` selects exactly that asset and not its `V2/` sibling.

## Gotchas

- **A failed build leaves the previous asset untouched.** Parsing, module resolution, input-name
  checks and value lowering all complete against an in-memory plan before anything is mutated. This
  is deliberate and differs from DreamShader, whose regeneration notes record the opposite ordering
  as a defect.
- **Stack issues are not reported headlessly.** Reading them needs a Slate-backed view model, which
  does not exist in a commandlet — asking for them there crashes the process, so the driver does
  not. A headless run reports Niagara *compile events* instead, which is what a CI gate needs.
  Open the asset in the editor to see the rest.
- **An input gated by a static switch cannot be written until the switch is set.** Source order is
  write order, so put `WriteSpriteSize = true` before `SpriteSize = …`. Writing the gated input
  first fails with `DFX5021` and a message about the EditCondition.
- **Undeclared system stacks keep whatever they already hold.** Declaring `SystemUpdate = { }` is
  how you take ownership of that stack; leaving it out preserves the engine's default `SystemState`
  module, and the run says so with a `DFX5003` info line.
- **`-All` on an empty source tree exits `0`**, logging a warning that no sources were found. A
  green run does not prove anything was built — check the `built` count in the summary line.
- **Emitter names are stable keys, not display names.** Renaming an emitter in source orphans every
  literal input on it, because Niagara stores those under an emitter-prefixed alias. The build
  refuses a name collision rather than silently uniquifying.

## Diagnostic codes

| Range | Meaning |
| :-- | :-- |
| `DFX1xxx` | lexical — unterminated string, bad character |
| `DFX2xxx` | syntax |
| `DFX3xxx` | name / asset resolution — unknown module, unknown input, ambiguous name |
| `DFX4xxx` | type checking — wrong type, wrong component count, narrowing conversion |
| `DFX5xxx` | lowering and asset generation |
| `DFX6xxx` | Niagara's own compile events, mapped back onto source |
| `DFX7xxx` | drift verification (`verify`) and lint |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| :-- | :-- |
| `EngineAssociation '{…}' is not registered.` | pass `-Engine <root>` or set `UE_ENGINE_ROOT` |
| `Could not find a .uproject at or above …` | pass `-Project` |
| `UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe not found at …` | the engine root is wrong — it must be the directory *containing* `Engine/` |
| `dfx: FAILED` with no `LogDreamFX` line | re-run with `-Raw`; the failure was before DreamFX got control |
| `0 built, 1 up to date` | add `-Force` |
| `DFX3001` no module named X | run `dfx.ps1 list` to see what the search paths expose, or add the folder to `Settings.ModulePaths` |
| `DFX7001` no provenance stamp | the asset was not generated from this source. Build it once |
| `DFX7002` stale asset | source changed since the last build. Run `build` |
